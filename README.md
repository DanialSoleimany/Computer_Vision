# Part 1: Solve 🔟 Image Processing Tasks with Python 🐍

This repository contains Python 🐍 implementations of 🔟 basic image processing tasks, utilizing the OpenCV 🟢👁️ library. These tasks are designed to familiarize users 👥 with fundamental operations in image manipulation and drawing ✍️ using Python.

## ⚙️ Installation

To run ▶️ the scripts in this repository, you will need to have Python 🐍 and OpenCV 🟢👁️ installed. You can install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## 📝 Tasks Overview

The following is a list of the 🔟 tasks solved in this part of the project:

1. 📸 **Make a Photo**
   - Make empty black image of size (400, 300, 3).

2. 💡 **Turn On a Pixel**
   - Set a specific pixel to a desired color.

3. 📏 **Draw Horizontal & Vertical Line**
   - Draw both a horizontal ↔️ and a vertical ↕️ line on an image.

4. ◼️ **Draw a Hollow Square**
   - Draw a square outline with adjustable size and position.

5. ⬜ **Draw a Solid Square**
   - Draw a filled square of specified size and location.

6. 📐 **Draw an Arbitrary Line Using the Line Formula**
   - Use the formula of a line to draw an arbitrary line on an image.

7. 🔵 **Circle Drawing**
   - Draw a circle with given center coordinates and radius.

8. 🔄 **Symmetry to Horizontal & Vertical Line / Coordinate**
   - Reflect an image along a horizontal ↔️ or vertical ↕️ axis to achieve symmetry.
   - Additionally, turn on a pixel in the reflected image to correspond to a specific point.

9. 🌈 **Create a Gradient Image**
   - Generate an image with a gradient effect, transitioning smoothly between colors 🎨.

10. ♟️ **Make a Chessboard**
    - Create a classic chessboard ♟️ pattern using alternating black ◼️ and white ⬜ squares.
